# boring-calculator
Calculator app, but the operations need to be the opposite of what the user gives.  
# Use cases  
    1. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, & Division operations must be available.  
    2. When the user clicks on the addition operation, the calculator must subtract, and vice versa.  
    3. When the user clicks on the multiplication operation, the calculator must do the division operation and vice versa.  
    4. Also, the numbers need to be opposite; let's say the user clicks on number "1," but the number needs to be printed/displayed as "9". So 1<->9, 2<->8, 3<->7, 4<->6, 5<->5
